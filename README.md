# Packer template for Windows Server 2019 Vagrant box

Minimalist [packer](https://packer.io/) template for running 
[Windows Server 2019 standard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/windows-server-pricing) 
in a [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) provider.

Based on excellent work by [Dr. Guszt√°v Varga](https://github.com/gusztavvargadr/packer/) - 
refactored for minimalism and being able to run in a Linux environment without chef.
